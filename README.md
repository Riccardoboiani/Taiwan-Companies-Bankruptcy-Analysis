# Taiwan-Companies-Bankruptcy-Analysis
The data were collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009. Company bankruptcy was defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.

A company faces bankruptcy when they are unable to pay off their debts. The Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009 has listed the details of company bankruptcy based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The Taiwan Stock Exchange was established in 1961 and began operating as a stock exchange on 9 February 1962. It is a financial institution located in Taipei, Taiwan. It has over 900 listed companies. The data includes a majority of numerical attributes that help understand the possibility of bankruptcy.

This notebook aims at analyzing the possibility of whether an organization would face bankruptcy. The main focus of this notebook is to demonstrate concepts listed as follows:

Dealing with imbalanced datasets the right way
(A detailed look on all the do's and don't has been demonstrated in "Credit Fraud || Dealing with Imbalanced Datasets" notebook by "Janio Martinez Bachmann". This notebook provides complete clarity for dealing with imbalanced datasets)

An imbalanced dataset is a situation when there is an unequal distribution of classes in the dataset. We can solve this by either upsampling - introducing minority class at power with majority class or downsampling - reducing majority class to match the size of minority class

Finding the best attributes to work with through feature selection

We are now dealing with over 50 attributes in this dataset, let us just play around and demonstrate how we can programmatically pick the best features, and analyze how it affects our model.

Appreciate any feedback or suggestions. Thanks!
